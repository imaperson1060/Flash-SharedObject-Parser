# Flash SharedObject Parser

Here is a C# class for parsing Flash (ActionScript 2) SharedObject data. Useful for editing save files for old games in C#.
Only primitive types are implemented: bool, int, string.
Huge thanks to [TurboMask](https://github.com/TurboMask/Flash-SharedObject-Parser) for making an AS3 version of this that I edited slightly to fit the [AMF0 format](https://web.archive.org/web/20090122195745/http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=27026&group_id=131628).

### Usage

File Test.cs contains example of how this class can be used in C#.
